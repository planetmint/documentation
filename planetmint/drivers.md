Connectors to BigchainDB are referred to as drivers within the community. A driver is used to create valid transactions, to generate key pairs, to sign transactions and to post the transaction to the BigchainDB API.

These drivers were originally created by the original BigchainDB team:

* [Python Driver](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/py-driver/en/latest/index.html)
* [JavaScript / Node.js Driver](https://github.com/bigchaindb/js-bigchaindb-driver)
* [Java Driver](https://github.com/bigchaindb/java-bigchaindb-driver)

These drivers and tools were created by the BigchainDB community:
