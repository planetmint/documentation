This section contains auto-generated documentation of various functions, classes and methods in the BigchainDB Server code, based on Python docstrings in the code itself.

Warning

While we try to keep docstrings accurate, if you want to know _for sure_ what the code does, then you have to read the code itself.

* Command Line Interface
* The BigchainDB Class
* Database Backend Interfaces
