# Introduction

### Setup Instructions for Various Cases

* Quickstart link below
* [Set up a local BigchainDB node for development, experimenting and testing](http://docs.bigchaindb.com/en/latest/installation/node-setup/index.html)
* [Set up and run a BigchainDB network](http://docs.bigchaindb.com/en/latest/installation/network-setup/index.html)

### Develop an App Test

To develop an app that talks to a BigchainDB network, you’ll want a test network to test it against. You have a few options:

1. The IPDB Test Network (or “Testnet”) is a free-to-use, publicly-available test network that you can test against. It is available at [IPDB testnet](https://test.ipdb.io).
2. You could also run a BigchainDB node on you local machine. One way is to use this node setup guide with a one-node “network” by using the all-in-one docker solution, or manual installation and configuration of the components. Another way is to use one of the deployment methods listed in the [network setup guide](broken-reference) or in the [the docs about contributing to BigchainDB](broken-reference).
